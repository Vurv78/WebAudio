desc("update(xwa:)", "Sends all of the information of the object given by functions like setPos and setTime to the client. You need to call this after running functions without running ``:play()`` or ``:pause()`` on them since those sync with the client. Returns 1 if could update, 0 if hit transmission quota")

-- Modify Object
desc("setDirection(wxa:v)", "Sets the direction in which the WebAudio stream is playing towards without updating it. Remember to call ``self:update()`` when you are done modifying the object!")

desc("setPlaybackRate(xwa:n)", "Sets the playback speed of a webaudio stream. 2 is twice as fast, 0.5 being half, etc.")
desc("setParent(xwa:e)", "Parents the stream position to e, local to the entity. If you've never set the position before, will be parented to the center of the prop. Returns 1 if successfully parented or 0 if prop wasn't valid")

desc("setRadius(xwa:n)", "Sets the radius in which to the stream will be heard in. Default is 200 and (default) max is 1500.")

-- Replicated Clientside behavior on server
desc("getTime(xwa:)", "Returns the playback time of the stream in seconds.")

-- Info received from client
desc("getLength(xwa:)", "Returns the playback duration of the stream in seconds. Will return -1 if couldn't get length.")
desc("getFileName(xwa:)", "Returns the file name of the WebAudio stream. Will usually be the URL you give, but not always. Will return \"\" if we haven't received the name yet.")
desc("getFFT(xwa:)", "Returns the fast fourier transform of the webaudio stream. Only works if self:EnableFFT(true) is called before. It is an array of 64 numbers or less, ranging from 0 to 2^12")
